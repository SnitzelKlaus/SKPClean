My instructor gave me the task of creating a cleaning program for the school, for fun (meaning the program is only being used in theoretical means and does not exist in real practises).

As of now, i've only managed to build up the database and "diagrams" for the project. I've started on the application now, but due to school starting up soon, i have to put this on the side for the time being.

I'll be back in august 2022 though! (maybe)
